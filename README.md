# Work-Day-Scheduler

## About the Project
Third party api's are an essential part of any programmers tool belt. By utilizing jquery to traverse through the dom, dayjs to give me current date and time, and bootstrap to style the page; I built a work day scheduler application to help students keep track of their time.
